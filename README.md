CalUber is a ride sharing application that intends to link Calvin students together in  order to streamline the process of finding a ride to destinations in the Grand Rapids area
and large cities in surrounding states. Unlike Uber or Lyft, this app is Calvin specific and gives students a cheaper option of carpooling with other Calvin students.
This application also enables long distance drives for students looking to go home for a holiday or the end of the school year.
We know there is a demand for such a service because the Free and For Sale Calvin Facebook page is frequently filled with posters looking for rides to or from Calvin, especially around holiday times.
 Our application would remove some of this clutter from the F&FS page and make it easier to connect with drivers. This application brings both drivers and passengers together on one platform to make communication quick and easy.
