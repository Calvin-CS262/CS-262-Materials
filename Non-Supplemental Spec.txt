Specifications:

The user should be able to learn the application in less than five minutes.
The maximum acceptable system downtime would probably be about a day, depending on what time of the year it is. If it is close to a school break, maximum acceptable system downtime decreases dramatically, probably to a few hours.
The user should be able to create a profile page in ~4 min and create or join a ride in ~3 min. Our application size should not be greater than 930 MB.
For testability puposes, our application should have at least three tests for every feature to test every possible outcome (test driven development).
Since we don’t expect an overwhelming amount of users, we don’t believe our application performance should deteriorate; our application architecture will not grow organically with the growing traffic and user base.
